NEMA14 gearbox modified to use 2 x M5 washers and 2 x 695ZZ bearings instead of the printed spacers and 2 x MR85ZZ bearings.
Slightly increased tolerances on the gearbox base to improve fitting and slightly larger cable cutout.

The printed spacers were used because no standard washer is small enough to work with the MR85ZZ bearings, I managed to shatter both printed spacers during assembly so I designed this mod to be more robust. In addition the side-to-side clearance for the 80T pulley is increased (from 0.5mm to 3mm per side) making this design more tolerant of slight variations in the assembly.
